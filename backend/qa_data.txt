The ZOC program addresses this by providing centralized support, structured systems, proper tools, and experienced mentorship to significantly improve success rates.

•	Global coordination with local autonomy
•	De-risking and sustainable income focus

Dialogues have started in multiple regions with early adopters showing positive engagement. The extensive 2-3 years of research and gradual rollout demonstrate the viability of the model.
Q37: What's the cost to participate as an ambassador? A: There is no upfront cost to become an ambassador. ZOC covers platform costs, resources, and support. Ambassadors only pay for optional paid services they choose to engage with (branding, graphics, event management, etc.). The program is designed to be accessible without requiring significant financial investment from ambassadors.
Q38: How much time do I need to dedicate weekly? A: The commitment varies based on your chosen involvement level:
•	Minimum: Participate in weekly and monthly meetings (2-3 hours/week)
•	Standard: Add content creation and local networking (5-8 hours/week)
•	Active: Full engagement with local events and community building (10-15 hours/week) ZOC can help execute activities, so you don't have to do everything yourself.
